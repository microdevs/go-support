### go-support

Commonly used go tools.

Each package is a different go module.

##### Motivation
This project is created for convenience of other developers to reuse commonly created golang code.
In every go project we need for example to create proper interfaces or mocks for underlying libraries (especially that in go word, a lot of implementation does not even provide interfaces at all).

##### First steps
At first we will start providing interfaces and mocks for commonly used libraries that we need.

##### Contribute
Feel free to open any PR and contribute.
